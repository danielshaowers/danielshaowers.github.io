# Statics: a firm foundation
- pawn structure, material advantage, holes and weak squares, backwards pawns, space
- static advantages last a long time. In such a case, there's often no rush to capitalize on the static advantage immediately if there are other more important things
- static advantage can be converted to dynamic advantage as well.
	- e.g if we pile up on an enemy pawn, the opponent might have to become extremely passive to protect it

# Dynamics: A firm fist
- piece activity, king safety
- dynamic advantages are transient - use it or lose it!
- dynamic advantages can often be converted into static ones
	- we can force the opponent to make their pawn structure worse, gain material, etc.
- chess is often a debate over static vs dynamics. Does one compensate for the other?


it's critical to know if the position demands static or dynamic play. Typically, there is one superior answer and you need to read the position to find it by looking at the imbalances. Done right, the board will usually scream what's expected of you.


# Summary
- Neither dynamics nor statics is superior inherently. It's up to the player to judge which is more valuable
- Dynamics are like a flare that burns bright for a few moments before fading into oblivion
- Still, dynamics can light up the board when you thought you had a static lock!
- It's critical to consciously notice when the position demands static vs dynamic play
- Transformations between static and dynamic advantages are very common
