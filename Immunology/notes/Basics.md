# The Basics
## Where Immune Cells Are Found
Immune cells differentiate from **progenitor cells
Progenitor cells** are found in the primary lymphoid organs (_bone marrow and thymus_)
**Circulating leukocytes**: mature immune cells that circulate through blood vessels
Within tissues and epithelial barriers, resident sentinel cells reside to sense microbes and respond to infection.
**Lymphocytes** are abundant in the lymphatic system
**Lymph** : fluid that drains from tissues to the heart through lymphatic vessels.
Lymphocytes concentrate in the lymph nodes, which are connected to the lymphatic system.
These secondary lymh organs are critical to robust pathogen-specific immune response.

**Innate Immunity**: The body's immediate mechanism to combat infection. Mechanisms that exst prior to infection. delivers rapid response to microbes.  
Agnostic to the specific infection type --> they react the same way to all infections.
Inflammation is a common, essential part of innate immune response.

**Adaptive Immunity**: Complex defense system that develops after exposure to the microbe. Extremely specific to distinct molecules, with specialized immune response depending on the type of microbe. Has the ability to remember and respond vigorously to repeated exposure of the same microbe (memory).

Mediated by **lymphocytes** with highly diverse **antigen receptors**.

Two types of adaptive immunity
1. B cell mediated
2. T cell mediated

# Innate Immunity
- all the immune defenses before any exposure to a pathogen
- same reaction to repeated infections
- very rapid response
- required to activate the adaptive immune system
