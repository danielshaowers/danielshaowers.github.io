This will be my home directory for immunology notes. somehow I would like it if this could direct to all my notes
I would like to one day have it expand upon clicking in a filetree fashion rather than redirecting but I don't want to deal with that for now.

1. [Basics]({% link Immunology/notes/Basics.md %})

The path is relative to the root directory (where the config file is), not the path of this file.
