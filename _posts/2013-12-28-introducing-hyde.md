title: About Me
---

Hello! I'm Daniel Shao. I'm a first year student at MIT-Harvard's Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Program in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics (MEMP). I'm broadly interested in developing machine learning algorithms with clinical applications. I'm hoping to use this blog as an opportunity to document and share various concepts I learn along the way. Hopefully it can serve as guidance for those interested in getting started on similar career paths in the future! In my free time I love to play chess, so I'll also include some details of what I'm studying there! If I'm not studying or researching, you can probably find me playing chess at Harvard Square.
### My research

I've done a variety of research projects in my undergrad. Including

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Bacterial shape regulation at the Rutgers Camden Klein lab
* 
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
