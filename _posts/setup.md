<p class="message">
  I have a pretty fun and unique desk setup that some of you looking to optimize your workflow may be interested in. In particular, I have the [ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) keyboard, which is this fun split keyboard that lets you position the two halves to whatever distance feels most natural to you. It looks really wacky, but it makes a world of a difference when youre typing in front of a computer for 8+ hours a day.

## Keyboard Layout

I recently made the switch during the summer of 2021 from QWERTY to Dvorak. I was pretty fast at QWERTY (about 100-110 WPM on average) but I wanted something a little more efficient, and I thought switching keyboard layouts would be a nice fun challenge.
I'm up to 80 WPM after typing in Dvorak for 3 months. Here are my overall thoughts

* It definitely feels more efficient. The 10 most common letters in english are all on the home row, with the vowels on the left side and consonants on the right. Because vowels and consonants often alternate in English, I rarely use the same hand to type multiple letters in a row, which is both faster and more efficient.  
* There is officially no going back. I have no idea how to type on qwerty, which may be a bit of a challenge when i inevitably have to use a public computer.


## Autohotkey

I cannot speak enough praise about autohotkey. Essentially it's a program that lets you set up custom hotkeys to make typing more efficient. For instance, when I hit "Caps Lock" and "backspace" together, it deletes the entire word rather than a single letter. Additionally it always annoyed me that I would have to move my hand to use the arrowkeys, so I made some hotkeys such that "caps lock" with h goes left, i goes up, t goes down, n goes left (the same orientation as with arrow keys, but now i dont have to move my fingers from the homekeys).
Lastly I have an autohotkey such that caps lock only activates when i tap it twice. This way caps lock doesnt turn on every time i try to use my hotkeys.

These may sound like small differences, but trust me in the long run it makes a huge difference! try it out if you want, I'll attach the code to the scripts below.
